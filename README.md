Unleash the true meaning of the LandTiger.

# scotlandyARM - A multi-peripheral - secret spies - Star Wars related project for LandTiger LPC 1768 development board
The project has been developed while attending Computer Architectures course at MS in Computer Engineering, Politecnico di Torino, year 2017/2018.

The task was to choose and use some peripherals of the LandTiger Development board, equipped with a NXP LPC 1768 chip.
We needed many of them, so you will find plenty of juice debugging this project!

The peripherals and functions used within the project:

- Speaker tone() with PWM
- Print lines and entire wall of texts with Display
- Manage timer and IRQ handlers
- Get robust input from the joystick
- Exchange data online through Ethernet Communication

It may be required to make sure that Keil uVision correctly manages
the paths.

# Usage
* Flash the board through uVision
* Enjoy :)

**NOTE**: Make sure that you have correctly set the Python server on a machine listening on the Remote IP defined in the source! Firewalls
could block the communication between the board and the machine.
